# Zenford Theme

A subtle but easy-to-parse theme for Xcode, based (barely) on the Zenburn theme, with some Dusk influence as well.

The font depicted in screenshot is Droid Sans Mono (12pt), which can be found at [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Droid+Sans+Mono).

## Installation

Just place the `Zenford.dvtcolortheme` file in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes`, and restart Xcode.
