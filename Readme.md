# Zenford Theme

A subtle but easy-to-parse theme for Xcode, based on the Zenburn theme, with some Dusk influence as well.

(Font depicted in screenshot is Droid Sans Mono, which can be found at [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Droid+Sans+Mono))

Just place the `Zenford.dvtcolortheme` file in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes`, and restart Xcode.
